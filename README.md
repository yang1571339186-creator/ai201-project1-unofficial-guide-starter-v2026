# Unit 1

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences. Which corpus you picked, and the kinds of
     questions your system answers. Write it for someone who has never seen
     this repo.

     Milestone 5. -->
The corpus I picked is the city_guides. THe system should therefore be able to answer questions about the cities listed under those documents. In addition, the system should reject irrelvant questions of these cities or questions about cities not found in the document. 

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size: 237 x 4**
**Overlap: 824 x 4**

<!-- What about YOUR documents made you pick these numbers? Short posts and
     long sectioned guides don't want the same chunking, and "800 seemed
     reasonable" earns nothing. Point at something you noticed when you read
     the documents in Milestone 1.

     If you changed your mind partway through, say so and say why. That's worth
     more than pretending you got it right first time.

     Milestone 3. -->

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

# Getting around the region with limited mobility

An honest assessment rather than a promotional one. Some of these places are
difficult and it is better to know in advance.

## Straightforward

**Thornby Wells** is the easiest town in the region. It is flat, compact, and
everything is within three minutes of everything else. Parking is free for two
hours anywhere in town and the station is central. The pump room and gardens
are level throughout.

**Marchwood** has a modern tram network with level boarding on all four lines,
running every 8 minutes on weekdays. The city museum and covered market are both
step-free. The distances between districts are the main consideration.

**Brightwater** is level along the river and through the centre. The mill museum
is step-free. The station is a 15-minute walk from campus on flat ground, or the
shuttle meets the four busiest arrivals.

## Mixed

**Pellew Sands** has a two-mile seafront that is

Chunk 2  |  source: guide_corry_vale.md#9  |  produced by: chunker.py::fallback_split
======================================================================
s is not a place with options.

## What to see

The valley itself is the attraction. The footpath network is dense and well marked, and a circuit taking in three of the four villages is about nine miles with 500 metres of ascent. The chapel in the second village is 12th century and always unlocked.

## Where to stay

Perhaps thirty beds in the entire valley, spread across two pubs and a handful of farmhouse rooms. In summer these are booked months ahead. Camping is permitted on two marked fields and nowhere else.

## When to go

May to September. Outside those months the pub in the third village closes, the farm shop reduces its hours, and several footpaths become genuinely boggy rather than merely wet. The road is not gritted above the second village and is impassable in snow.

## Practical notes

Cash is still useful at the market and in smaller places, though cards are
accepted almost everywhere now. Mobile coverage is good in the

in both directions for as far as you want to walk.

## Eat and drink

A tearoom attached to the mill, open 10 to 4 daily except Tuesdays, which sells bread made from the flour ground twenty metres away and is the reason most people come. One pub, food served lunchtimes and Thursday to Saturday evenings.

## What to see

The mill runs tours on the hour from 11 to 3 and the machinery is operating during them, which is loud and much more impressive than a static exhibit. The church has a Saxon doorway. The river walk downstream reaches Brightwater in about three hours.

## Where to stay

Nothing in the village itself. The nearest rooms are in Brightwater, which is close enough that this is not really a problem — most people come for a half day.

## When to go

The mill runs March to November and is closed entirely in winter. Late spring is the best time. Summer Saturdays are busy enough that the car park becomes the limiting factor; come

rs pass through rather than stop in. That is a mistake, though an understandable one, since almost nothing of interest is near the station.

## Getting there

Every railway line in the region meets here, which is the city's defining feature. Trains to Brightwater run every 40 minutes until 11pm. The airport is 20 minutes out by a dedicated bus that runs every 15 minutes and costs more than the equivalent taxi shared between three people.

## Getting around

A tram network of four lines, running every 8 minutes on weekdays and every 15 at weekends, until midnight. A day ticket costs less than two single fares and nobody tells you this at the machine. The centre is walkable but the interesting districts are not adjacent to each other.

## Eat and drink

The best eating is in the Northgate district, a 12-minute tram ride from the station, where about thirty restaurants sit within four streets. The area immediately around the station is u

on a good surface. The
old railway trackbed from Kestrelford runs six miles on an easy gradient and is
the best walking in the region for the effort involved. The coastal path from
Halden Bay is more serious — exposed, and closed in high wind.

Cycling is pleasant on the river path and the trackbed, and unpleasant on Mill
Road and the coast road, neither of which has a shoulder.

## Sample Answer

<!-- One complete question and answer, pasted as text, with the source line
     visible. Milestone 4. -->

```
**Question: Best time of year to visit thornby well's gardens**

**Answer: The best time to visit the gardens in Thornby Wells is in May and June (*guide_thornby_wells.md*).

Sources retrieved: guide_givens_mill.md, guide_thornby_wells.md, guide_walking.md**

**My relevance cutoff: 0.47**

<!-- The number you set in config.py, and how you got there.

     You ran five questions your corpus covers and the five in OUT_OF_SCOPE
     that it clearly doesn't, and wrote down the best distance for each. What
     did those two groups look like? Where was the gap? Put the actual numbers
     here — the table below wants all ten rows.

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

     Milestone 5. -->

**1. One specific thing I asked for is to find the average size of the documents as well as the lowest and highest, this hlped
informed the size of the overlap and chunk**

**2.Another thing that the AI helped me on is understanding the code base, there is a lot of code so asking claude for an overvewi is very helpful**

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
